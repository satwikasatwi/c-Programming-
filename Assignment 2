You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

program:


int arrangeCoins(int n){
    long int k = sqrt(2*(long int)n);
    long int sum=k*(k+1)/2;
    if(sum>n)return k-1;
    return k;

}
